main.py — NovaCart Account Dashboard API

Built with FastAPI. Auto-generated docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs

Endpoints:
  GET /health                                  — service health check
  GET /authorize                               — SPCS OAuth flow
  GET /franchise/{id}/summary                  — overview stats
  GET /franchise/{id}/orders                   — monthly order volume and revenue
  GET /franchise/{id}/products                 — top products by revenue
  GET /franchise/{id}/customers                — top customers by revenue
  GET /franchise/{id}/countries                — revenue by country (city/state for US data)

Data schema (from the DE capstone Gold layer):
  fact_orders:   order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, amount, currency, status, quantity, date_key
  dim_customer:  customer_id, name, email, addr_city, addr_state, valid_from, valid_to, is_current
  dim_product:   product_id, name, category, price
  dim_date:      date_key, year, quarter, month, month_name, day_of_week

Your job: implement the TODO sections in each endpoint.
The connection and query helpers are already set up in connection.py.
